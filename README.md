# Silverfox
Silverfox is a 2D open-world RPG inspired by the light-novel I am currently writing entitled "Diary of the twilight princess"
My project is to make this game a unique adventure for everyone, as such it will provide a lot of customization.
When I am done working on the main 'story mode', I will most likely work on muliplayer.

For a bit of context, "Silverfox" takes place in a medieval-fantasy sort of world, in which you play as a fox-person, the storyline is enierly free and
doesn't force the player to be the good guy.
This means that depending on the player's choices can ifluence the original story enough to make their experience an entirely new story.

I intend to realize this project on my own, but if anyone is interested they can contribute, I would appreciate your help especially on the frontend part.
